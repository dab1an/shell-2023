Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was to address a pressing need among college and university studentsâ€”making informed financial decisions, especially when it comes to credit cards. Drawing inspiration from the Vanguard challenge and leveraging technologies like Next.JS, React.js, and OpenAI, we set out to create a cutting-edge web application. Our vision was to design an intuitive questionnaire that users could fill out to express their financial goals, spending habits, and preferences. Behind the scenes, our AI-driven backend, powered by OpenAI, would analyze these responses to recommend the most suitable credit card options. This innovative approach combines user-friendly design, educational resources, and the power of AI to empower students in managing their finances effectively and building a better financial future.

How we built it
In crafting this project, we embarked on a journey of innovation and knowledge. Inspired by the Vanguard challenge and our commitment to improving financial futures, we dove into the development process. Leveraging our skills in Next.JS, React.js, and harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI, we designed an AI-driven credit card match. Alongside this, we incorporated TailWind, TypeScript, and LineChain to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. These technologies were the building blocks of our project, allowing us to create a user-centric and accessible platform. This journey taught us that technology, when harnessed thoughtfully, can be a powerful tool for financial empowerment, underlining the importance of blending technology, education, and AI to address real-world financial needs.

Challenges we faced next
During our project development, we faced challenges, mainly related to merge conflicts, which caused delays in our progress. We resolved these issues by improving our communication within the team. By talking more often and openly, we successfully tackled merge conflicts together.
